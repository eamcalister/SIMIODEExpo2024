  <p>By the time students get to second-order equations, the process of turning second-order equations into systems of first-order equations is intuitive. General systems beyond those from second-order equations just require one more link in the diagram. Furthermore, Insightmaker supports the ability to switch between the two-dimensional phase portrait and time series graphs.</p>
